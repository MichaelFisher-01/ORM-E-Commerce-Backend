# ORM Ecommerce Back End

## Description
This project will create a database of products, categories and tags that can be used by an e-commerce site to keep track of inventory and sort items into different categories for easy look up. When entered GET, POST, PUT or DELETE commands the user will be able to alert the information in any way they see fit whether it is just gathering information, creating new products, or removing products from the system.
